regimens: nivolumab (at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks); nivolumab

ipilimumab has also been approved as adjuvant therapy for melanoma on the basis of recurrence-free and overall survival rates that were higher than those with placebo in a phase 3 trial.","We wanted to determine the efficacy of nivolumab versus ipilimumab for adjuvant therapy in patients with resected advanced melanoma.","METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 906 patients (\u226515 years of age) who were undergoing complete resection of stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma to receive an intravenous infusion of either nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks (453 patients) or ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses and then every 12 weeks (453 patients).","The patients were treated for a period of up to 1 year or until disease recurrence, a report of unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent.","The primary end point was recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.","RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 18 months, the 12-month rate of recurrence-free survival was 70.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.1 to 74.5) in the nivolumab group and 60.8% (95% CI, 56.0 to 65.2) in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.65; 97.56% CI, 0.51 to 0.83; P<0.001).","Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 14.4% of the patients in the nivolumab group and in 45.9% of those in the ipilimumab group; treatment was discontinued because of any adverse event in 9.7% and 42.6% of the patients, respectively.","Two deaths (0.4%) related to toxic effects were reported in the ipilimumab group more than 100 days after treatment.","CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing resection of stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma,

randomised phase 2 trial of patients aged 18 years or older from 73 hospitals, clinics, and academic medical centres in 12 countries who had confirmed progressive disease within 24 weeks after two or more ipilimumab doses and, if BRAF(V600) mutant-positive, previous treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor or both.","Patients had to have resolution of all ipilimumab-related adverse events to grade 0-1 and prednisone 10 mg\/day or less for at least 2 weeks, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion to be eligible.","Using a

antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were shown to be more effective than ipilimumab.","Ipilimumab combined with nivolumab gives an incremental gain in overall survival compared with nivolumab alone but increases the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening toxicities.","In contrast to ipilimumab monotherapy, anti-PD-1 antibodies are licensed to be continued until disease progression.","Follow-up of patients recruited to the first trials evaluating 2\u2009years of pembrolizumab showed that three-quarters of responding patients continue responding after stopping treatment.","Suggestive of early response, we hypothesised that continuing anti-PD-1 treatment beyond 1\u2009year in progression-free patients may be unnecessary and so designed the DANTE trial.","METHODS: DANTE is a multicentre, randomised, phase III, non-inferiority trial to evaluate the duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with metastatic (unresectable stage III and stage IV) melanoma.","It uses a two-stage recruitment strategy, registering patients before they complete 1\u2009year of first-line anti-PD-1 +\/- CTLA-4 therapy and randomising eligible patients who have received 12\u2009months of treatment and are progression-free at 1\u2009year.","At randomisation, 1208 patients are assigned (1:1) to either 1) continue anti-PD-1 treatment until disease progression\/ unacceptable toxicity\/ for at least 2\u2009years in the absence of disease progression\/ unacceptable toxicity or 2) to stop treatment.","Randomisation stratifies for baseline prognostic factors.","The primary outcome is progression-free survival at 3, 6, 9 and 12\u2009months and then, 6-monthly for up to 4-years.","Secondary outcomes collected at all timepoints include overall survival, response-rate and duration and safety, with quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes collected 3-monthly for up to 18-months.","Sub-studies include a qualitative analysis of patient acceptance of randomisation and sample collection to inform future translational studies into response\/ toxicity biomarkers.","DISCUSSION: DANTE is a unique prospective trial investigating the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.","Outcomes will inform future use of these high burden drugs.","TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN15837212 , 31 July

function, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.","This Phase 2 study evaluated the 24-week progression-free survival (PFS) value, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of 2 doses of ontuxizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.","Patients and methods Patients with metastatic melanoma and disease progression after receiving at least 1 prior systemic treatment were randomized to receive ontuxizumab (2 or 4\u00a0mg\/kg) weekly, without dose change, until disease progression.","Results Seventy-six patients received at least 1 dose of ontuxizumab (40 received 2\u00a0mg\/kg, 36 received 4\u00a0mg\/kg).","The primary endpoint, 24-week PFS value, was 11.4% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 5.3%-19.9%) for all patients (13.5% for 2\u00a0mg\/kg and 8.9% for 4\u00a0mg\/kg).","The median PFS for all patients was 8.3\u00a0weeks (95% CI: 8.1-12.3\u00a0weeks).","One patient receiving 4\u00a0mg\/kg had a partial response, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1.","Twenty-seven of 66 response evaluable patients (40.9%) had stable disease.","The median overall survival was 31.0\u00a0weeks (95% CI: 28.3-44.0\u00a0weeks).","The most common adverse events overall were headache (55.3%), fatigue (48.7%), chills (42.1%), and nausea (36.8%), mostly grade 1 or 2.","Conclusions Ontuxizumab at both doses was well tolerated.","The 24-week PFS value was 11.4% among all ontuxizumab-treated patients.","The overall response rate was 3.1% at the 4\u00a0mg\/kg dose, with clinical benefit achieved in 42.4% of response evaluable patients.","Efficacy of
